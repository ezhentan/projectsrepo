# Objective

* Predicting Grab's customer churn 
* Effectiveness of integrating sentiment analysis on Grab's customer reviews gathered from its Facebook page

# Summary

To conclude, this report shows that findings from text mining can be useful to a company in conducting market intelligence, as it can improve the performance of the model trained. Overall, the best model is logistic regression including the sentiment input, with an accuracy of 61%, which is on par with the baseline. 

### Limitations

One limitation of this report is that the dataset is relatively small in terms of attributes. For the model to perform better, more information is likely needed, such as how many days has passed since the customer last took a Grab ride, and the customerâ€™s occupation. 

Another limitation is the lack of background information about the customers who posted the reviews. Some of the posts in the Community tab may not all be reviews. In the mix are posts in which Grab Singapore was mentioned in, such as a news site mentioning Grab Singapore in a post. Hence, with user background information, more of such posts can be filtered out to ensure that the posts scraped are truly customer reviews and feedback.
