This repository is for my prior projects that I completed for my Python module.

## gba.py and history.txt

A brief summary of this file:

Objective: To create a dictionary, where 
  (a) users can enter new words and example sentences, and 
  (b) also review the words they have entered with two options, either by latest revision time or highest frequency.
  
history.txt is where the dictionary and the existing words are stored.

The code that I did achieved these. For objective (a), my group members and I decided to create our dictionary in a json file, as we could use different data types. As shown in history.txt, the dictionary that we needed could be added to a larger dictionary, hence enabling ease of editions (i.e. {"dictionary": {"word": [[sentence], amount, date]}}).
