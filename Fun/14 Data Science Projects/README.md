Many thanks to Terence S for the inspiration and the project ideas.

I decided to challenge myself to complete all the projects in the article (although I may exceed the suggested timeline of 14 days) to explore methods of data analysis that I may not have tried before. For one, I have not used Plotly to visualise data, which is a graphing library used in the first project of visualising the coronavirus spread. I hope to improve my skills by at least 1% with every project I complete!

I am also documenting my progress on my website, linked [here](https://ezhentan.netlify.app/2020/09/24/14-data-science-projects/). I will still be uploading my notebooks here, as the codes are not included there.
