# About Me

I am an aspiring data analyst. I am currently pursuing a Business Analytics degree at the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS). As a Year 2 student, I have taken a Python module, and have learnt basic coding using Python and R. My GitHub will be linked as well, where I have uploaded my class assignments for your persual. Do check back regularly, as I will be uploading more.

When I am not studying, I am teaching English at a local tuition centre. I have worked at the centre as a teaching assistant for more than a year before converting to be a part-time teacher.
